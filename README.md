## 1. What is Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows. Airflowâ€™s extensible Python framework enables you to build workflows connecting with virtually any technology. A web interface helps manage the state of your workflows. Airflow is deployable in many ways, varying from a single process on your laptop to a distributed setup to support even the biggest workflows.
